Description: This package is focused on functional enrichment. It provide utilities for downloading gene sets from popular databases,
    perform over-representation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).
    It also provide an utility to compute an activation score for each gene set in each sample using a PCA (similar to Pathway Level analysis of Gene Expression or PLAGE).
    This gene score is use to perform a Gene Set Differential Scoring (GSDS) to identify gene sets that are differentially activated between two conditions.
