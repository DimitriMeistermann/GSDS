\title{Compute the activation score of a gene set from 1st component of its PCA}
\usage{
activScorePCA(
  exprMatrix,
  genes,
  transpose = TRUE,
  scale = FALSE,
  center = TRUE,
  returnContribution = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exprMatrix}{A matrix of numeric with rows as features (in the RNA-Seq context, log counts).}

\item{genes}{A character vector. The gene set where the activation score has to be computed. Must be a subset of \code{exprMatrix} row names.}

\item{transpose}{Logical. If TRUE, \code{exprMatrix} is transposed with \code{t()} before computing the PCA.}

\item{scale}{Logical. Divide features by their standard deviation.}

\item{center}{Logical. Subtract features by their average.}

\item{returnContribution}{Logical. Return list with activation score and contribution of genes to the activation score.}
}
\value{
A vector of numeric corresponding to activation scores, named by genes. If \code{returnContribution} return a list with activation scores and contributions of genes.
}
\description{
Compute the activation score of a gene set from 1st component of its PCA
